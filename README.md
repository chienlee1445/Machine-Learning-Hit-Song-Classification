# Machine-Learning-Hit-Song-Classification

## Overview

In the dynamic realm of the music industry, understanding the determinants of a song's success has been a longstanding area of interest. The advent of digital platforms such as Spotify has provided an unprecedented wealth of data, enabling a deeper exploration of musical trends and audience preferences. This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of a track becoming a 'Hit' or a 'Flop,' utilizing a comprehensive dataset obtained through Spotify's Web API spanning the years 1960 to 2019.

## Dataset

The dataset, meticulously curated and labeled, includes diverse features for each track, such as tempo, danceability, instrumentalness, energy, and more. The binary classification of 'Hit' or 'Flop' serves as ground truth for training the predictive model. It is important to clarify that the designation of 'Flop' does not imply a qualitative judgment on artistic merit but signifies perceived popularity in the mainstream.

## Objectives

Using machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover patterns within the data to illuminate key characteristics associated with musical success. Whether it's infectious beats, lyrical content, or a combination of features, the model seeks to identify factors contributing to a song's commercial success. This predictive capability holds significant implications for artists, producers, and industry stakeholders, providing actionable insights to enhance decision-making processes and potentially increase the likelihood of crafting a hit song.

## Exploration and Impact

As we delve into music analytics, the project not only showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting musical success but also underscores the evolving intersection of technology and the arts. Through Spotify's vast music catalog, this endeavor contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the factors that resonate with audiences, shaping the trajectory of a song in the ever-evolving music industry.

## Temporal Focus

The dataset selected for predicting the Model Hit Song specifically spans the decade from 2010 to 2019. This choice acknowledges the notable transformations in the music industry during this period, representing a pivotal epoch. Focusing on this timeframe ensures that the predictive model aligns with contemporary public aesthetics, discerning key factors instrumental in predicting a hit song in the current dynamic music industry landscape.
